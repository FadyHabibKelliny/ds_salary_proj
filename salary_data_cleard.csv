SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

We certainly believe that building a successful company starts with the people, and while the chance to meet and collaborate face to face in an office setting is vital to our growth and company culture, the health and safety of the Takeoff team is the most important right now. To that end, we are embracing a “work remote first” company policy, however the expectation is that you are based in the Greater Boston / MA area to ensure time zones are aligned with the rest of the Takeoff team based on the east coast.

Whether it be a Cultural Brunch & Learn, a Rocketberry Mini-Series showcasing some of our teams dynamic and hidden talents, or a weekly “coffee chat” to catch up with your fellow colleagues, we are finding creative ways to stay connected and engaged with each other during these challenging times.

Lastly along with our robust and competitive benefits package that we offer(above), we are excited to roll out two new benefits; a “remote work allowance” as well as a “remote office setup reimbursement”. These benefits will be effective immediately upon hire date geared towards ensuring that our employees are continuously set up for success while working remotely!

Data Scientist,$101K-$160K (Glassdoor est.),"Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact, 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

As our first Data Scientist, you will own our entire data pipeline, from instrumentation and extraction to analytical presentations to the executive team. Building Internet infrastructure is expensive and our business model relies on leveraging data to find as many efficiencies as possible. To that end, you’ll work with Product to find creative ways to reduce hardware costs, with Growth to squeeze every last conversion out of our onboarding funnel, with Engineering to discern network-wide ramifications of minute changes to router kernel parameters, with Coverage to sketch out the best buildings to target when we launch new markets, and with Operations to identify process breaks before they show up in our top-level metrics.

The ideal candidate is passionate about democratizing our data and eager to wear many hats -- one day might entail installing Tableau and coaching stakeholders on best practices with the new BI tool, while another might involve changing our backend to emit that one metric that’s going to drastically simplify the analysis you’re trying to run. Our entire stack runs on GCP, with BigQuery as our data warehouse and all of our backend written in golang on Google’s Appengine -- bonus points if you come in with experience in those technologies, but we’d also be thrilled to invest in a great candidate that hasn’t worked with those exact products.
What you do
Build and maintain dashboards for core operational metrics (e.g. network reliability, growth funnel)
Own the methodologies behind how we measure ourselves and create new metrics as the business evolves
Clean and organize our data warehouse, manage scheduled aggregations, and expose rich views of data to stakeholders
Run your own investigations into our trickiest problems, finding approachable ways to present and visualize your findings to the rest of the company
Implement simple changes to our codebase when necessary -- you don’t let yourself get blocked on engineering
Chart out Common’s data roadmap, striking the right balance between quick-and-dirty analysis vs. building out robust, scalable data flows.
Requirements
BS with 5+ years of professional experience in a Data Scientist or Data Analyst role
Solid programming skills in at least one language in addition to excellent SQL skills
Experience working with and manipulating large, complex datasets.
Experience solving non-routine analysis problems, choosing the appropriate analytical methods and carrying the entire analysis from initial data gathering and requirements specification to final reporting and stakeholder presentation
Experience building, managing and organizing ETLs and data pipelinesExperience working with stakeholders to produce golden data datasets and clear views of common data needs
Excited to work in a startup environment on a small team; creative, resourceful, comfortable in a fast-moving environment. Excited to take on a wide range of responsibilities and cover many different roles loosely aligned around Data.
Demonstrated leadership and self-direction with a willingness to both teach others and learn new techniques.

About Us VIDEO

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

Big Data Analyst BSLEP7,$86K-$128K (Glassdoor est.),"E3/Sentinel’s Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE) division is an integrated organizational entity fostering increased collaboration and synergies across the Homeland domain. HSE combines the skills and talents of over 245 (and growing) E3S employees and subcontractor staff supporting multiple components across DHS, including but not limited to: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD), Federal Protective Services (FPS), and the DHS Headquarters Management Directorate. Our team provides rapid, innovative and specialized solutions that enable our HSE clients to success at meeting dynamic mission objectives.

Each day U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) oversees the massive flow of people, capital, and products that enter and depart the United States via air, land, sea, and cyberspace. The volume and complexity of both physical and virtual border crossings requires the application of “big data” solutions to promote efficient trade and travel.
Through the use of effective “big data” technologies and solutions, CBP ensures that the movement of people, capital, and products is legal, safe, and secure. In response to this challenge, ManTech, as a trusted mission partner of CBP, seeks capable, qualified and versatile data analysts to facilitate data-driven decision making in response to national security threats.
The primary objective of the data analysis team is three-fold: 1) Support the development of predictive models via the identification of behaviors and attributes that inform illicit activities; 2) Provide on-demand analysis to support emergent operational needs; and, 3) Develop performance dashboards and artifacts to inform resource allocation, justify requirements, and support statutory reporting mandates.
In all three areas, data analysts must be capable of transforming large volumes of raw data, both structured and unstructured forms, into mission-focused insights that enhance understanding of mission performance, workload, and/or behavioral trends (i.e., strategic, tactical, and operational insights). Analysts may be called upon to support a diverse array of initiatives involving complex queries in support of network analysis, entity resolution, threat research, visualization, and impact assessments.

The strongest applicants will engage in highly dynamic, threat/risk driven operating environments. They will bring a proven track record of working with decision support tools and applications operationally employed by mission-support entities. Within three to six months of joining the project, we expect analysts will:
Master relevant data schemas, reference data, joining conditions, and relationships of existing databases, as well as associated warehouses and data marts, involving trade, travel, national security, and law enforcement data.
Conduct exploratory analysis demonstrating: a refined understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying data; a willingness to explore non-traditional data sources and evaluation methods; and a clear link to mission need.
Construct query code as well as run, save, edit, optimize, and document queries using SQL and other languages including Spark to extract mission-critical insights.
Design, develop and deliver analytic artifacts such as dashboards, scorecards, and structured Excel reports that: support executive-level, at-a-glance findings; empower non-technical users to explore user-specific equities (e.g. PowerBI); and/or provide detailed information informing operational outcomes.
Assess validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity of data as well as develop mitigation steps and processes to address data quality issues in support of clean data.
Translate findings (e.g. mission impacts, limitations of findings/ analytical confidence, analytical methods and techniques employed) to clearly articulate the “so what” within the context of mission performance to technical and non-technical audiences in the form of written reports and in-person briefings.
Engage internal and external stakeholders in a professional and informed manner to collect analysis requirements and ensure alignment of expected outcomes.
Integrate with, and materially contribute to, portfolio teams as a matrixed resource to provide data analytics expertise in support of modeling, ad hoc query support, or performance assessment initiatives in collaboration with data scientists, intelligence analysts, developers, and other participants under the direction of a project manager.
Applicants should note that while some formal training exists to support building knowledge of missions and the implementation of data-driven solutions, but much of the knowledge must be gained through on-the-job training and individual initiative. Technical knowledge is insufficient to achieve effectiveness in this operating environment; expertise must be enhanced with rapid acquisition of mission knowledge and demonstrated commitment positive mission outcomes. Therefore, we seek self-starters who are capable of independent exploration and knowledge acquisition, willing to develop informal support networks, and with an appreciation for the immense challenge of safeguarding the Nation’s borders.

Big Data Analyst BSLEP7,$86K-$128K (Glassdoor est.),"E3/Sentinel’s Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE) division is an integrated organizational entity fostering increased collaboration and synergies across the Homeland domain. HSE combines the skills and talents of over 245 (and growing) E3S employees and subcontractor staff supporting multiple components across DHS, including but not limited to: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD), Federal Protective Services (FPS), and the DHS Headquarters Management Directorate. Our team provides rapid, innovative and specialized solutions that enable our HSE clients to success at meeting dynamic mission objectives.

Each day U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) oversees the massive flow of people, capital, and products that enter and depart the United States via air, land, sea, and cyberspace. The volume and complexity of both physical and virtual border crossings requires the application of “big data” solutions to promote efficient trade and travel.
Through the use of effective “big data” technologies and solutions, CBP ensures that the movement of people, capital, and products is legal, safe, and secure. In response to this challenge, ManTech, as a trusted mission partner of CBP, seeks capable, qualified and versatile data analysts to facilitate data-driven decision making in response to national security threats.
The primary objective of the data analysis team is three-fold: 1) Support the development of predictive models via the identification of behaviors and attributes that inform illicit activities; 2) Provide on-demand analysis to support emergent operational needs; and, 3) Develop performance dashboards and artifacts to inform resource allocation, justify requirements, and support statutory reporting mandates.
In all three areas, data analysts must be capable of transforming large volumes of raw data, both structured and unstructured forms, into mission-focused insights that enhance understanding of mission performance, workload, and/or behavioral trends (i.e., strategic, tactical, and operational insights). Analysts may be called upon to support a diverse array of initiatives involving complex queries in support of network analysis, entity resolution, threat research, visualization, and impact assessments.

The strongest applicants will engage in highly dynamic, threat/risk driven operating environments. They will bring a proven track record of working with decision support tools and applications operationally employed by mission-support entities. Within three to six months of joining the project, we expect analysts will:
Master relevant data schemas, reference data, joining conditions, and relationships of existing databases, as well as associated warehouses and data marts, involving trade, travel, national security, and law enforcement data.
Conduct exploratory analysis demonstrating: a refined understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying data; a willingness to explore non-traditional data sources and evaluation methods; and a clear link to mission need.
Construct query code as well as run, save, edit, optimize, and document queries using SQL and other languages including Spark to extract mission-critical insights.
Design, develop and deliver analytic artifacts such as dashboards, scorecards, and structured Excel reports that: support executive-level, at-a-glance findings; empower non-technical users to explore user-specific equities (e.g. PowerBI); and/or provide detailed information informing operational outcomes.
Assess validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity of data as well as develop mitigation steps and processes to address data quality issues in support of clean data.
Translate findings (e.g. mission impacts, limitations of findings/ analytical confidence, analytical methods and techniques employed) to clearly articulate the “so what” within the context of mission performance to technical and non-technical audiences in the form of written reports and in-person briefings.
Engage internal and external stakeholders in a professional and informed manner to collect analysis requirements and ensure alignment of expected outcomes.
Integrate with, and materially contribute to, portfolio teams as a matrixed resource to provide data analytics expertise in support of modeling, ad hoc query support, or performance assessment initiatives in collaboration with data scientists, intelligence analysts, developers, and other participants under the direction of a project manager.
Applicants should note that while some formal training exists to support building knowledge of missions and the implementation of data-driven solutions, but much of the knowledge must be gained through on-the-job training and individual initiative. Technical knowledge is insufficient to achieve effectiveness in this operating environment; expertise must be enhanced with rapid acquisition of mission knowledge and demonstrated commitment positive mission outcomes. Therefore, we seek self-starters who are capable of independent exploration and knowledge acquisition, willing to develop informal support networks, and with an appreciation for the immense challenge of safeguarding the Nation’s borders.

Currently, we’re building a product pipeline of cannabinoids, the active compounds in the cannabis plant. Humans have been relying on cannabinoids for health and medicinal purposes for centuries.

Currently, we’re building a product pipeline of cannabinoids, the active compounds in the cannabis plant. Humans have been relying on cannabinoids for health and medicinal purposes for centuries.
Although there are more than 113 unique cannabinoids, very few have been studied. That’s because they are present in such low quantities in the plant. We can produce even the rarest cannabinoids at high purity and volumes. What this will do is enable research for health benefits and, ultimately, provide affordable access to the compounds.",-1.0,Demetrix,"Berkeley, CA",-1,1 to 50 Employees,2017,Company - Private,Biotech & Pharmaceuticals,Biotech & Pharmaceuticals,Unknown / Non-Applicable,-1,0,0,107,173,140.0,Demetrix,1, CA,0,0,0,0,0

More than a job


Where you work isn't just a career decision -- it's a life decision. We get it. That's why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.
4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays. Whether it's hiking to a waterfall in Costa Rica or bonding with your couch, we all need downtime. All Gurus get four weeks paid time off, 10 sick days, and enough holiday to make a banker blush.
Let's get lunch. Lunches are catered three times per week, and our kitchen stays stocked with a smorgasbord of the team's most requested snacks and drinks.
Parking is on us. We have your Downtown parking covered. We offer paid garage parking nearby the office. We also have perks for going green by walking and taking public transit.
We've got you covered. We offer insurance plans that pay for 100% of your medical, dental, and vision, and 80% for your family/dependents.
Gender-neutral paid parental leave. Expanding your family? We offer 12 weeks of gender-neutral paid parental leave, and reimburse up to $10,000 for eligible adoption expenses.
$1,000 continuing education budget. All Gurus get $250 a quarter to spend on personal development, and 2 hours each week reserved for learning something new.
What's the interview process like at ACG?


Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn't have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It's our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.

Once you submit an application, we'll review it. If you're a good fit, you'll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we'll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it's really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.

Senior Data Scientist,$90K-$162K (Glassdoor est.),"About Shift


We believe car buying should be fun, fair, and accessible to everyone. We've set out to transform an industry, using technology to bring transparency and convenience to the car buying process.

And we aren't stopping there. We seek to bring that same openness and simplicity to car ownership too, with payments, maintenance, and insurance in one easy app. At Shift, we're building the tools that empower people to buy, own, and sell the cars that make life go.

About the role


Data is core to this transformation, from building best-in-class pricing, to loan decisioning, to logistics optimization, to in-product recommendations. If you're passionate about using data to fix an enormous, antiquated industry, you'll fit right in.

The data

Millions of cars are bought and sold in the US every year, but knowing exactly how much your car is worth is a challenge. We believe that fixing the used car industry requires providing customers with fair, detailed pricing reports in beautiful, easy-to-understand interfaces. By combining as much data as we can get our hands on, from the millions of listings available online, to car auction sales, to every vehicle's specific repair history, we're building the most accurate, transparent pricing tool in the industry.

The impact

As a two-sided marketplace, serving both car buyers and sellers, our vehicle data and pricing models are core to the business. As a Senior Data Scientist, you will have direct and immediate impact on the success of the company. Initial projects will include exploring data, building models, informing product decisions, overseeing experiments, and collaborating closely with engineers on our pricing team. Over time, you'll play a crucial role in growing and mentoring a team of data scientists that will be involved in nearly every initiative at Shift, including lead scoring, user acquisition, optimal resource allocation, vehicle routing, and more.

What you'll do:
Build models from the ground up - from data exploration to feature engineering, to model development + optimization, and deployment into production
Design rigorous experiments and interpret results to draw actionable conclusions
Work cross-functionally with team leaders (in Engineering, Product, Operations, Marketing, etc.) to explain your analysis and make recommendations
Facilitate objective decision making across the company by democratizing data through dashboards and other analytical tools
What we ask for:


Bachelor's Degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, or other quantitative field; advanced degree a plus
4+ years of industry experience in a quantitative analysis role
Knowledge of machine learning techniques, especially deep understanding for their benefits and drawbacks in real-world applications
Excellent statistical intuition derived from practical, hands-on experience
Proficiency in Python
Experience writing efficient SQL
Excellent communication skills that you've leveraged to influence product and leadership teams
Curiosity, desire to learn, passion for providing a great product to customers
On diversity


Our company depends on balance and equality between buyers and sellers, among employees, and in our relationships with customers.

Our mission to evolve car ownership and transform an industry is a challenging one. It can only be achieved by a team of diverse problem-solvers engineers, designers, business people from the same broad demographics as our customers.

Why join now?


We've built a small but highly talented team backed by >$275 million in funding from investors like DFJ, Goldman Sachs, BMW, and Nissan. In October 2018 we announced a deep partnership and a $140m round led by the third largest auto retailer in the US, Lithia Motors. With strong product-market fit and a great business in California, the next two years will be focused on scaling the business nationally.

What Youll Get to Do:

The Contractor team shall be responsible for evaluating, identifying, architecting, developing, prototyping, and deploy solutions that satisfy the needs of the Customer and its mission partners. Once deployed, the contractor will be responsible for O&M of the solutions. The Customer wishes to avoid unnecessary isolation of data through the establishment of a compelling default data lake. The solution must readily accept diverse data sets; supporting ingestion in both an ad-hoc and continuing manner. Orchestration of this data ingest must not be constrained to a single team, but instead must support a community of resources empowered to ETL data into the platform. This data lake solution must be complemented by multi-tenant analytic compute platforms for data Scientists and developers facilitating analytics at scale and rapid lab-to-factory development. The platform must make data available for query, manipulation, and allow developers to join/comingle data sets with each other. Again, these abilities must be accessible to a vast community of development resources empowered to independently perform these operations on this common platform whilst enforcing appropriate access control. Moreover, the platform must enable developers and data scientists to behave as a cooperative community by allowing the creation of novel analytic capabilities that readily build upon the output of existing analytic capabilities.

More About the Role:

The Contractor shall assist the Customer in evaluating open source, commercial, and existing solutions available within the Customers environment. The Contractor shall identify solutions, produce illustrative prototypes, and work with the Customer to generate recommendations and an implementation roadmap. To the greatest extent feasible, these solutions will build atop and augment existing Customer investments.

The Contractor shall develop analytic capabilities aimed at facilitating information discovery, summarization, or to aid the interpretation of patterns within. This development activity may include identifying existing analytic tradecraft of value and performing tech transfer as necessary. The Contractor shall have experience with data science and have successfully delivered analytic capabilities.

The Contractor shall assess and validate candidate systems, applications, and open source modules as potential elements for inclusion into the Customer system. The Contractor shall identify key interdependencies, roadblocks, issues, and risks with modifying existing systems and develop/integrate/implement a plan to proactively address these issues in a timely manner.

The Contractor shall evaluate existing Customer capabilities, familiarizing themselves with system architecture and inherit the development responsibilities for those capabilities and systems as directed by the Customer. The Contractor shall work with the Customer to generate and document requirements for new system development. The Contractor shall develop new systems to satisfy Customer approved requirements, and subsequently develop, document, and execute test plans, procedures, and scenarios for acceptance testing. The Contractor shall validate and verify that the developed software successfully meets Customer requirements and interfaces properly with related systems through configuration, installation, and performance testing of the software.

The Contractor shall comply with the Customers Assessment and Authorization process, addressing auditing requirements, and providing required system documentation through the accreditation process. The Contractor shall work with the Customer to develop, implement, and maintain a strategy for appropriately handling security sensitive applications.
